Skip to the [sample content](/devops/sample-content/).

The content marketing team is building an SEO optimized microsite that will focus on DevOps and Continuous Deployment. 

The team intends to be fairly nimble in how we work, with an initial goal of releasing an MVP version of the site by August, and then iterating quickly to improve SEO results and the effectiveness of the content.

We're also seeing other people similar sites also focused on DevOps and we're eager to achieve first-mover advantage.

## Goals

The goals of the site are:

 1. attract targeted organic traffic to octopus.com
 1. educate visitors about DevOps principles and Continuous Delivery
 1. raise aware of Octopus Deploy as a solution
 
The site is not commercial in nature, but intended to educate and build credibility with potential users over time. The site is **not** a sales brochure for Octopus Deploy, however, there may be times when we use Octopus to demonstrate the DevOps principles we're documenting.
 
The microsite should be fairly self-contained, even though the site will live at www.octopus.com/devops. Links to other parts of octopus.com should be deliberate and guide visitors to take the next steps from awareness to interest and onto consideration through bold CTAs/links at the bottom of the page to:

- Octopus blue papers
- Octopus free tools
- Octopus free trial

## Style 

The style will focus on long form written content supplemented (we hope) with illustrations that support the content and elevate the brand/credibility of Octopus as a reputable domain expert.

## Navigation

The top navigation should be limited to the microsite and not use the standard top nav from octopus.com. The current version is animated, but doesn't need to be. 

Ideally, the main navigation for the microsite will be similar to left sidebar in docs. 
 - Parent pages expand when clicked to reveal child pages
 - On smaller screens the the sidebar should be hidden but accessible through a hamburger icon or at the bottom of the content.

### To Do
 
Add an ordering mechanism for the listing the content in the sidebar.
