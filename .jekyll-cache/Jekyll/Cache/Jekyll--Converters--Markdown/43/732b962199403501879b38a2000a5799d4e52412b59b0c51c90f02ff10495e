I"ì<p>In traditional organizations, developers and those that support them (such as operations or database teams) are often separate entities with little interaction.</p>

<p>This means each team has its own beliefs, responsibilities, and priorities. While not at odds, often those priorities can clash in pursuit of doing best for the business.</p>

<p>Embracing DevOps as a culture means to remove that friction by introducing a shared purpose.</p>

<p>The methods to achieve that can differ and depend how entrenched people are in their ways of working. The aim, however, is to ensure all teams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build trust through clear, honest communication and feedback</li>
  <li>Collaborate throughout the productâ€™s entire lifecycle</li>
  <li>Have what they need to make quick decisions</li>
  <li>Can take risks without fear of failure or blame</li>
  <li>Are collectively responsible for the productâ€™s success</li>
  <li>Review what worked and what didnâ€™t for the next lifecycle</li>
</ul>
