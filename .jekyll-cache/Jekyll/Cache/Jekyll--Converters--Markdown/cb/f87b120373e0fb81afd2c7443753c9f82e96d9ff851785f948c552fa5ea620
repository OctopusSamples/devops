<p>In modern development, itâ€™s more important than ever to deliver software and updates as quickly and reliably as possible.</p>

<p>The concept behind DevOps, then, is about removing barriers that get in the way of software delivery.</p>

<p>Typical barriers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Manual processes</li>
  <li>Office politics</li>
  <li>Counteractive support workflows</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason to overcome these barriers is simple: If the product is software, then all processes should work towards delivering that software, not against it.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s look at what we must consider when thinking about a DevOps approach.</p>
